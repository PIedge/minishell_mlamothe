This flow chart is the order in which things in minishell moves.

This flow chart supposedly imitates bash.

As it is not required to copy bash to a T it might have some diferences.

Lexicon:
	-Blank: space or tab.
	-Word: Sequence of characters considered
	-Name: A word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning
			only an alphabetic character or an underscore. Also refered to as an Identifier.
	-Metacharacter: A character that, when unquoted, separates words. One of the following:
					| & ; () < > <space tab>
	-Control Operator: A token that performs a control function. One of the following:
						|| & && ; ;; () | |& <newline>

Details:
	-Variables names: Acceptable variables name are defined as follows:
			[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*

According to the subject of minishell we need to do this:
	-Not interpret unclosed quotes or any Metacharacters/Control operator not specified.
	-Use only one global variable if nessary.
	-Show a prompt on readline.
	-Have a working history.
	-Search and launch the right executable.
	-Implement following buildins:
			-echo with option -n
			-cd with relative or absolute path
			-pwd no options
			-export no options
			-unset no options
			-unset no options
			-env no options or arguments
			-ext no options
	-' character should inhibit everything, nothing is speacial anymore
	-" should inhibit everything except $
	-Redirections:
			-< should redirect input
			-> should redirect output
			-<< should read niput from current source until a line containing the delimiter 		is seen. It doesn't need to update history
			->> should redirect output with append mode
	-Pipes | The output of each command in the pipelines is connected via a pipe to the 			input of the next command.
	-Environment variables ($ followed by character) should expand to their value (see 				acceptable "Variables names" section in Details)
	-$? should expand to the most recent exit status
	-ctrl-C D \ should work like in bash
	-In interactive mode:
			-ctrl-C should print a newline
			-ctrl-D exit the shell
			-ctrl-\ does nothing

When in trouble read rtfm.
